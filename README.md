### Hi there! \o/ ðŸ‘‹

My name is Loyanne Cristine, I'm 31 years old, and I'm from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· I'm a postgraduate student in Computer Science (Software Developer) and I've been a doctor for four years, but for a year as a non-practitioner and in career transition (specialty) to healthtech. I'm an enthusiast of Data Science, Machine Learning, Innovation and Artificial Intelligence. I love to exchange knowledge and experiences. 

I'm a strong supporter of women's empowerment, gender equality, women in technology or anywhere they want to occupy, against racism and male chauvinism and anything else that might come to label someone.

I also like plants, rainbows, music festivals, assembling IKEA furniture, series, stock market and etc.
