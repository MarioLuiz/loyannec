### Hi there! \o/ ðŸ‘‹

My name is Loyanne Cristine, I'm 31 years old, and I'm from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· I'm postgraduated in Computer Science, currently master's student of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Medical Research and I've been a physician for four years, but for a year as a non-practitioner and in career transition (specialty) to healthtech. I'm an enthusiast of Data Science, Machine Learning, Innovation and Artificial Intelligence. I love to exchange knowledge and experiences. 

I'm a strong supporter of women's empowerment, gender equality, women in technology or anywhere they want to occupy, against racism and male chauvinism and anything else that might come to label someone.

I also like coffee, plants, rainbows, music festivals, assembling IKEA furniture, series, stock market and etc.

Would you like to find me?
